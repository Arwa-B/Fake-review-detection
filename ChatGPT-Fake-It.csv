If someone messages hateful words/harassment/swearing etc. in the messenger group, then the admins will not be able to remove because there is no option to remove the message, so it will cause a lot of problems, so in the messenger group, the admins should remove a message. Maybe that's why I request you to give the option to remove the message in the next update. Thanks In Advance 💙💙💙❤️❤️",1

Not only does it not stay open as a little tiny bubble like It's supposed to but it also does not alert you all the time if you're getting messages whether you're in a game or you're open in another Application.

2636,Very useful app. My concern is about privacy when i report a person harassing or sending inappropriate things it take action quickly but the block system is not that secured. Because the person you block they can still see your name and new profile picture. I think block is supposed to totally no access to see the person anything from your icon and profile name. I hope this help to other who suffering harassment and cyber bullying. I hoping for this next update.,1

3053,"Poor Android Auto Interface Whenever a message has been received, read, and responded to, Android Auto says you have unread messages. It stays this way until you are in the vehicle, have Android Auto on, go onto your phone, open the app, and scroll around for a bit. If you don't do this, Messenger will keep saying you have unread messages indefinitely until you open the app while your vehicle and Android Auto are on. No other messaging app does this aside from FB Messanger. Poor design.",1

4324,Problems with push notifications. This app does not send notifications if the app isn't open at all times. I have missed various messages from my daughter at uni that have been important. This has only been since changing my phone to a Google pixel 7 pro. My partner has the same issues with a Samsung galaxy s23. Surprised this app doesn't work properly with brand new phones. Stopped using it and using WhatsApp instead as this actually works. I was only keeping my Facebook profile for this app.,1
