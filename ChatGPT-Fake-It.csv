Because the person you block they can still see your name and new profile picture. I think block is supposed to totally no access to see the person anything from your icon and profile name.

It stays this way until you are in the vehicle, have Android Auto on, go onto your phone, open the app, and scroll around for a bit. If you don't do this, Messenger will keep saying you have unread messages indefinitely until you open the app while your vehicle and Android Auto are on. No other messaging app does this aside from FB Messanger. Poor design.",1
