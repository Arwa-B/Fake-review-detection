##Data Collection Process
Data was collected from two sources: the first one was Chat GPT, using simple queries describing the Facebook application and giving positive and negative reviews. In addition, queries asked for reviews related to some tools used on Facebook, like posts, photos, and friends. The second one was the Google Play Store. Using a Python library called "Google Play Scraper", we collected reviews posted by users about Facebook applications. This dataset contains 6013 reviews, of which 4000 are real reviews scrapped from the Google Play Store and 2013 are generated by Chat GPT. Data was collected in the form of text only, and a 5-star rating was excluded. The language of reviews was specified to be English only.

##Data Features
We extracted the length of the text, percentage of stop words, and percentage of words, and sentiment analysis was applied to give an indicator of whether this review is positive, negative, or neutral.
